jsframework -- the lightest weight framework
============================================

Include it:

    <script src="src/main.js"></script>

Then, use it:

    <script>
    JS.require("/mything.js", function(thing) {
        thing.beAwesome();
    });
    </script>

You should include modules for whatever non-core functionality you need.
jsframework is explicitly lightweight and doesn't impose policy -- this 
is a good thing!

Share it!
