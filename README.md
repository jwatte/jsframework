jsframework -- the lightest weight framework
============================================

Include it

    <script src="src/main.js"></script>

Then, use it
============

    <script>
    JS.require("/mything.js", function(thing) {
        thing.beAwesome();
    });
    </script>

You should include modules for whatever non-core functionality you need.
jsframework is explicitly lightweight and doesn't impose policy -- this 
is a good thing!


Share it!
=========

Don't be afraid; we've got your back; as long as you are a legitimate
developer!  Jsframework strikes that careful balance between inclusiveness and
moderation that's needed for a healthy online community.
